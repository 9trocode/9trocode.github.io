# About

I'm Alex Idowu, a Cloud Infrastructure and Software Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria.

## Work

Currently at [PipeOpsHQ](https://github.com/PipeOpsHQ), where I work on infrastructure automation and deployment platforms. Before that, I've spent over a decade building systems and tools.

I've been working in technology since 2012, focusing on:

- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker)
- CI/CD pipelines and automation
- Systems programming (Python, Go, TypeScript)

## Open Source

Active contributor with 152+ public repositories. I work on Terraform providers, cloud automation tools, and infrastructure utilities. I believe in building tools that solve real problems and sharing them with the community.

## Writing

I write about infrastructure, automation, and production systems. Topics include Terraform patterns, Kubernetes operations, cloud cost optimization, and lessons from incidents.
