## A Bit About Me

I'm Alex Idowu, a Cloud Infrastructure and Software Engineer based in Lagos, Nigeria. Currently, I'm building amazing things at PipeOpsHQ, where I focus on creating scalable infrastructure solutions.

I'm passionate about:

- Building reliable and scalable systems
- Automating repetitive tasks (because why do manually what you can automate?)
- Contributing to open source projects
- Sharing knowledge with the community

## Why This Blog?

I've always believed in the power of sharing knowledge. Throughout my career, I've learned so much from blog posts, documentation, and the generous sharing of others in the tech community. This blog is my way of giving back.

Whether you're a seasoned engineer or just starting your journey, I hope you'll find something valuable here.
