I build scalable infrastructure and automation tools. Currently at [PipeOpsHQ](https://github.com/PipeOpsHQ) in Lagos, Nigeria.

I work with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), infrastructure as code (Terraform), container orchestration (Kubernetes), and write code in Python, Go, and TypeScript.

## Writing

I write about infrastructure, automation, and lessons learned from production systems.
